		This site was originally for my AP Portfolio,
		I needed somewhere to put my photos for easy access.
		They are <a href="/showcases/APPhoto/">here</a>.
		<br>
		However, that was in highschool. I am now studying computer science at university.
		I plan on using this page as a portfolio, but that will most likely manifest
		itself in the form of online utilities.

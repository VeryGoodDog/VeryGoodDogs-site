	Here at <a href="/index.php">VeryGood.Dog</a>,
  I host most of my photos under <a href="/showcases/photos/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  I am taking an AP photo class right now.
  This requires me to have a website, which I clearly have.
  It also requires me host my breadth and concentration photos.<br>
	I had a different site under a less memorable URL, but now I made this one.
	This one is named after my late dog Bella, she was the orignal VeryGoodDog!
  <br>
  My breadth is <a href="breadth/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  My concentration is <a href="concentration/index.php">here</a>.<br>

  <h3 class="showcaseHeader">About Me:</h3>
	<p class="showcaseBody">
  I'm a senior in high school right now!
  I really like programming and art, but, like, I can't really draw.<br>
  So, I turned to photography.
	I love film photography, I built a darkroom in my basement.<br>
	It works, barely.<br>
	I also do digital photo.
	The photos I'll be hosting here will be labeled film or not.

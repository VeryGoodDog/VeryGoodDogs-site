  Here at <a href="/index.php">VeryGoodDog</a>,
  I host most of my photos under <a href="/showcases/photos/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  However, I am taking an AP photo class right now.
  This requires me to have a website, which I clearly have.
  It also requires me host my breadth and concentration photos.<br>
  <br>
  My breadth is <a href="breadth/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  My concentration is <a href="concentration/index.php">here</a>.<br>

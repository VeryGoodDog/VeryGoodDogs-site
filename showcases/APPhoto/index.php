  <h3>Info:</h3>
  Here at <a href="/index.php">VeryGoodDog</a>,
  I host most of my photos under <a href="/showcases/photos/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  However, I am taking an AP photo class right now.
  This requires me to have a website, which I clearly have.
  It also requires me host my breadth and concentration photos.<br>
  <br>
  My breadth is <a href="breadth/index.php">here</a>.<br>
  My concentration is <a href="concentration/index.php">here</a>.<br>

  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  I'm a junior in high school right now!
  I really like programming and art, but, like, I can't really draw.<br>
  <i>So</i>, I turned to photography.
  I really like <i>making</i> photos that you can't really tell what it is.
  At least, it's not realistic in some way.
  For example, <a href="breadth/photos/Hyper Worm.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>,
  or <a href="breadth/photos/ten dot jaypeg.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>,
  maybe even <a href="breadth/photos/u can do what ever - small.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.
